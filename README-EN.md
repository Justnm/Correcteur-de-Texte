Welcome to the "Text Corrector with ChatGPT" Chrome Extension page! This extension was developed as a personal challenge to explore the possibilities of integrating AI through API into web browser extensions.

The aim was to create a tool that could help users correct their text directly within their browser using artificial intelligence technology.

It is important to note that this project is still in its early stages. While functional, it requires much more effort and improvement to achieve optimal performance levels.

Feedback and contributions are therefore welcomed to help enhance its effectiveness and reliability.

The code for this extension is completely open source and available on GitHub.

This decision was made to encourage collaboration among developers and to allow anyone interested in Chrome extension development or the use of AI for text processing to contribute to and learn from this project.

I understand and appreciate the effort needed to refine and improve a tool like this, and I am open to any help or suggestions that may come from the community.

Prerequisites

Google Chrome: Ensure that you have Google Chrome installed on your computer.

Installation

Usage

Correct Text:

Select Correct Text from the context menu.
The extension will analyze the text in the field and apply necessary corrections.
A notification or a direct change in the text field will indicate that the text has been corrected.

Features

Automatic Correction: The extension uses the Gemini API by default to identify and correct spelling and grammar mistakes. However, you can configure it to use any API that offers similar capabilities.
Language Flexibility: Initially set to work with French text, this extension can be easily adapted to support any language. Customize it to meet your needs without worrying about licensing issues for language processing.
Multi-site Support: Works on all websites that allow text entry, including social networks, forums, and online editors.

Known Issues and Limitations

The extension requires an active internet connection to function because it needs to communicate with an API.
Corrections may not be 100% accurate at all times; use your judgment to accept the proposed changes.
